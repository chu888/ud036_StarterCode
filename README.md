"Movie Trailer Website" Project Overview:

This is an application using object-orentied python that is acessible via a web browswer.
The codes created a data structure to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. The codes generates a static web page allowing visitors to browse my favorite 9 movies and watch the trailers.

The "movie" folder contain the following:(entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py)
The "entertainment_center.py" created 9 instances from the "movie" Class contain in the "media.py" to represent my favorite movies. 
The "fresh_tomatoes.py" help generate a website that displays these movies, it provides a starter code repository that contains a Python module.
